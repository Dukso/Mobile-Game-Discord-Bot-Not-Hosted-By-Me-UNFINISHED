##THIS BOT IS WRITTEN IN PYTHON!

##Make sure to make your bot in the discord bot development page ( https://discord.com/developers/applications )
##Here are the things the bot will need:
##Go to The Bot and into the Bot Tab! 
##Under Privliged gateway Intents enable everything (Dont worry You can check the code if you do not trust this!
##Under those settings are the Bot Permisions where since I'm lazy I would put as Administrator (Again you can check the code)
##Now set the name! If you do not have an idea I reccomend A 

##Now onto Installations!
##Make sure Guild Install Is ON otherwie you will not be able tyo add it to aa server! I do not have User Install working (As of writing this) except from the $Test Command (I dont know why)
##Under that go to Install Link and select Discord Provided Link unless you have your own website which why? THis is just a lil silly bot

##Now we can go onto the code where just run the codeor if you know how to set it up on a 24/7 server thingy but I just do it so it automatically runs when my PC turns on!

##If you have any Issues with the imports I reccomend doing this command in terminal (You can do WINDOW LOGO + R type cmd and press enter Idk how to do it in Mac
pip install discord.py

##To get the bot token go to Your Bot > Bot
##if it dosn't show the token then press Reset Token!
